satisfied that the matter could more properly be dealt with by a magistrate
sitting at a place nearer the place where the applicant ordinarily resides, he

but such a refusal shall not, for the purposes of sections seventeen and
nineteen of this Act, be deemed to be a refusal of the application.<LF>

solemnizing the marriage not earlier than three months before the date of the
marriage and not later than the seventh day before the date of the marriage;<LF>
<LF>
  (b)  there has been produced to that authorized celebrant, in respect of
each of the parties-<LF>
<LF>
      (i)  an official certificate, or an official extract of an entry in an
official register, showing the date and place of birth of the party; or<LF>
<LF>
     (ii)  a statutory declaration made by the party or a parent of the party
stating that, for reasons specified in the declaration, it is impracticable to
obtain such a certificate or extract and stating, to the best of the

<LF>
     (ii)  the party's belief that there is no legal impediment to the

first-mentioned party in the presence of an authorized celebrant before the
marriage is solemnized, be deemed to have been a sufficient notice.<LF>
<P>  (4) Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable
inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party
required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to
include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to
ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this
section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnized, that party
furnishes to the authorized celebrant solemnizing the marriage a statutory
declaration as to his inability to ascertain the particulars not included in
the notice and the reason for that inability.<LF>

<P>  (6) Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of an authorized
celebrant to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any
other reason, it is impracticable for that person to solemnize the marriage,
the marriage may be solemnized by any authorized celebrant who has possession
of the notice.<LF>

section shall both be written on the one paper and on the same side of that
paper.<LF>

<LF>
  (a)  unless he has satisfied himself that the parties are the parties
referred to in the notice given under this section in relation to the
marriage; or<LF>
<LF>
  (b)  if he has reason to believe that-<LF>
<LF>
      (i)  a notice given under this section; or<LF>

before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnized and may treat the
corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.<LF>
<P>  (10) Where the declaration made by a party under sub-section (1) of this

inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party
required to be contained in a notice under this section, a failure to include
in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to ascertain
does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this section if, at
any time before the marriage is solemnized, that party furnishes to the
marriage officer solemnizing the marriage a statutory declaration as to his
inability to ascertain the particulars not included in the notice and the
reason for that inability.<LF>

particular case justify his so doing, solemnize a marriage notwithstanding

marriage.<LF>
<P>  (5)  Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of the marriage
officer to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any
other reason, it is impracticable for that officer to solemnize the marriage,
the marriage may be solemnized by any marriage officer who has possession of
the notice.<LF>

this section shall, if one of the parties to the intended marriage is not a
British subject, post up a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place in his
office and keep it so posted up until the intended marriage is solemnized or
the notice becomes void, whichever first occurs.<LF>

in the office of a marriage officer under the last preceding sub-section may
be inspected, without fee, by any person at any reasonable time before the
intended marriage to which the notice relates is solemnized or the notice
becomes void, whichever first occurs.<LF>
<P>  (8) Where a party to an intended marriage is stated in a notice under this
section to be a divorced person or a widow or widower, a marriage officer
shall not solemnize the marriage unless there is produced to him evidence of
that party's divorce, or of the death of that party's spouse, as the case
requires.<LF>
<P>  (9) A marriage officer shall not solemnize a marriage if he has reason to
believe that a notice given under this section, or a statutory declaration
made for the purposes of this section, in respect of the marriage contains a
false statement or an error or is defective.<LF>
<P>  (10) A marriage officer may permit an error in a notice under this section
to be corrected in his presence by either of the parties at any time before
the marriage to which the notice relates has been solemnized and may treat the
corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.<LF>
