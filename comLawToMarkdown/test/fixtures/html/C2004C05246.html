accordance<LF>
with this section and has been received by the authorized celebrant
solemnizing the marriage not earlier than 6 months before the date of the
marriage and not later than 1 month before the date of the marriage;<LF>
   (b) there has been produced to that authorized celebrant, in respect of
each<LF>
of the parties:<LF>
         (i) an official certificate, or an official extract of an entry in
an<LF>
official register, showing the date and place of birth of the party; or<LF>
         (ii) a statutory declaration made by the party or a parent of the<LF>
party stating that, for reasons specified in the declaration, it is
impracticable to obtain such a certificate or extract and stating, to the best
of the declarant's knowledge and belief and as accurately as the declarant has
been able to ascertain, when and where the party was born; and<LF>
   (c) each of the parties has made and subscribed before that authorized<LF>
celebrant a declaration, in accordance with the prescribed form, as to:<LF>
         (i) the party's conjugal status;<LF>
         (ii) the party's belief that there is no legal impediment to the<LF>
marriage; and<LF>

   (a) shall be in accordance with the prescribed form and contain such<LF>
particulars in relation to the parties as are indicated in the prescribed
form; and<LF>
   (b) subject to subsection (3), shall have been signed by each of the

Australian Federal Police or the police force of a State or Territory.<LF>
  (3) Where the signature of a party to an intended marriage cannot

this section, a notice duly signed by the other party and otherwise complying
with the provisions of this section shall, if it is signed by the
first-mentioned party in the presence of an authorized celebrant before the
marriage is solemnized, be deemed to have been a sufficient notice.<LF>
  (4) Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable
inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party
required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to
include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to
ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this
section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnized, that party
furnishes to the authorized celebrant solemnizing the marriage a statutory
declaration as to that party's inability to ascertain the particulars not
included in the notice and the reason for that inability.<LF>
  (5) A prescribed authority may, if satisfied that the circumstances of the
particular case justify so doing:<LF>
   (a) authorize an authorized celebrant to solemnize a marriage; or<LF>

there<LF>
is no other authorized celebrant suitable to the parties conveniently
available, solemnize a marriage himself or herself;<LF>
notwithstanding that the notice required by subsection (1) has been received
later than 1 month before the date of the marriage.<LF>
  (5A) An authorized celebrant shall, as soon as practicable after receiving
the notice referred to in subsection (1), give to the parties a document in
the prescribed form outlining the obligations and consequences of marriage and
indicating the availability of marriage education and counselling.<LF>
  (6) Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of an authorized
celebrant to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any
other reason, it is impracticable for that person to solemnize the marriage,
the marriage may be solemnized by any authorized celebrant who has possession
of the notice.<LF>
  (7) The declarations of the parties required by subsection (1) shall both be
written on the one paper and on the same side of that paper.<LF>
  (8) An authorized celebrant shall not solemnize a marriage:<LF>
   (a) unless the authorized celebrant has satisfied himself or herself that<LF>
the parties are the parties referred to in the notice given under this section
in relation to the marriage; or<LF>
   (b) if the authorized celebrant has reason to believe that:<LF>
         (i) a notice given under this section; or<LF>
         (ii) a declaration made and subscribed under this section, or a<LF>
statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section;<LF>
in relation to the marriage, contains a false statement or an error or is
defective.<LF>
  (9) An authorized celebrant may permit an error in a notice under this
section to be corrected in his or her presence by either of the parties at any
time before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnized and may treat
the corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.<LF>
  (10) Where the declaration made by a party under subsection (1) states that
that party is a divorced person or a widow or widower, an authorized celebrant
shall not solemnize the marriage unless there is produced to him or her
evidence of that party's divorce, or of the death of that party's spouse, as
the case requires.
